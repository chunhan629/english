            <h2 id="section-1">Early-Life</h2>
            <p> born September 30, 1928) Elie Wiesel was born in Sighet,  His parents were Sarah Feig and Shlomo Wiesel. At home Wiesel's family spoke Yiddish most of the time, but also German, Hungarian, and Romanian who grew up with three sisters and pursued religious studies at a nearby yeshiva, was influenced by the traditional spiritual beliefs of his grandfather and mother, as well as his father's liberal expressions of Judaism..</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="section-2"> World War two </h2>
            <p>Surviving the Holocaust
                In 1944, Nazi Germany forced Jews who resided in Bulgaria, 
                Hungary and Romania to relocate to labor and death camps in Poland. 
                At the age of 15, Wiesel and his entire family were sent to Auschwitz as part 
                of the Holocaust, which took the lives of more than 6 million Jews. Wiesel lived 
                in the camps under deplorable, inhumane conditions, gradually starving, and was ultimately
                freed from Buchenwald in 1945. Of his relatives, only he and two of his sisters survived..</p>
            <p> In 1940, Romania lost the town of Sighet to Hungary following the Second Vienna Award. In 1944,
                Wiesel, his family, and the rest of the town were placed in one of the two ghettos in Sighet.
                Wiesel and his family lived in the larger of the two, on Serpent Street.</p>

            <h2 id="section-3">After War ( 1946 - 1948 )</h2>
            <p> In 1946, after learning of Irgun's bombing of the King David Hotel, Wiesel made
                an unsuccessful attempt to join the underground movement. In 1948 he translated articles
                from Hebrew to Yiddish for Irgun periodicals, but says he was not a member of the organization..</p>
            <hr>
            <h2 id="section-4">After War (1960 - 1997 )</h2>
            <p> In 1960 Arthur Wang of Hill & Wang agreed to pay a $100 pro-forma advance and published it in the United States in September that year as Night. The book agent was Georges Borchardt, then just starting his career. Borchardt remains Wiesel's literary agent today.
                The book sold just 1,046 copies over the next 18 months, but 
                attracted interest from reviewers, leading to television interviews with 
                Wiesel and meetings with literary figures such as Saul Bellow. "The English translation 
                came out in 1960, and the first printing was 3,000 copies," Wiesel said in an interview. 
                "And it took three years to sell them. Now, I get 100 letters a month from children about 
                the book. And there are many, many million copies in print." The 1979 book and play The Trial
                of God are said to have been based on his real-life Auschwitz experience of witnessing three 
                Jews who, close to death, conduct a trial against God, under the accusation that He has been 
                oppressive of the Jewish people. Regarding his personal beliefs, Wiesel calls himself an agnostic.</p>
            <p> Night has been translated into 30 languages. By 1997 the book was 
                selling 300,000 copies annually in the United States alone. By March 2006,
                about six million copies were sold in the United States. On January 16, 2006, 
                Oprah Winfrey chose the work for her book club. One million extra paperback and 150,000 
                hardcover copies were printed carrying the "Oprah's Book Club" logo, with a new translation 
                by Wiesel's wife, Marion, and a new preface by Wiesel. On February 12, 2006, the new translation 
                of Night was No. 1 on The New York Times bestseller list for paperback non-fiction and the original 
                translation placed third.</p>

            <h2 id="section-5"> Life in -> United States & Recent </h2>
            <p> In 2004, he voiced support for intervention in Darfur, Sudan at the Darfur Emergency Summit convened at the Graduate Center
                of the City University of New York by the American Jewish World Service and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
                He also led a commission organized by the Romanian government to research and write a report, released in 2004, on the true
                history of the Holocaust in Romania and the involvement of the Romanian wartime regime in atrocities against Jews and other
                groups, including the Roma. The Romanian government accepted the findings in the report and committed to implementing the 
                commission's recommendations for educating the public on the history of the Holocaust in Romania. The commission, formally 
                called the International Commission for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania, came to be called the Wiesel Commission in honor 
                of his leadership.
Wiesel is the honorary chair of the Habonim Dror Camp Miriam Campership 
and Building Fund, and a member of the International Council of the New Yorkâ€“based Human Rights Foundation. On March 27, 2001, 
Wiesel appeared at the University of Florida for Jewish Awareness Month and was presented with an honorary degree from the 
University of Florida.
In 2002, he inaugurated the Elie Wiesel Memorial House in Sighet, in his childhood home. </p>
            <p> In early 2006, Wiesel traveled to Auschwitz with Oprah Winfrey, a visit which was 
                broadcast as part of The Oprah Winfrey Show on May 24, 2006. Wiesel said that 
                this would most likely be his last trip there. In September 2006, he appeared before the 
                UN Security Council with actor George Clooney to call attention to the humanitarian crisis 
                in Darfur. On November 30, 2006, Wiesel received a knighthood in London in recognition of his 
                work toward raising Holocaust education in the United Kingdom.
During the early 2007 selection process for the Kadima candidate for President of Israel, Prime Minister Ehud 
Olmert reportedly offered Wiesel the nomination (and, as the ruling-party candidate and an apolitical figure, 
likely the presidency), but Wiesel "was not very interested." Shimon Peres was chosen as the Kadima candidate
(and later President) instead.
In 2007, Wiesel was awarded the Dayton Literary Peace Prize's Lifetime Achievement Award. That same year, the
Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity issued a letter condemning Armenian genocide denial, a letter that was signed by 53 Nobel 
laureates including Wiesel. Wiesel has repeatedly called Turkey's 90-year-old campaign to downplay its actions during the
Armenian genocide a double killing.
Wiesel is a member of the International Advisory Board of NGO Monitor.</p>
